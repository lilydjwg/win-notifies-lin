This is a set of programs that notify a Linux desktop when there are watched notifications in Windows.

It's used to notify the Linux user when a watched program in a Windows virtual machine wants attention.

It's old (and uses a pretty share of CPU). I uploaded them here for interested people. No maintainance will happen in the foreseeable future.
